# 👋 Hi, I'm Talia Kusmirek
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Md973dN.png" width="200" alt="Talia Kusmirek" />

I'm an Boston College student double majoring in Computer Science and Business, with a deep interest in the ethical and impactful use of AI. I’ve worked across applied machine learning, AI ethics (UN research), and product development—from startups to top-tier academic projects.

I'm currently building tools that bridge technical innovation and social good: including a fashion-tech platform called **CIRA** and a Gen-Z founder collective called **HUMN**.
